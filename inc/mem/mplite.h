 * This file contains the APIs that implement a memory allocation subsystem
 * based on SQLite's memsys5 memory subsystem. Refer to
 * http://www.sqlite.org/malloc.html for more info.
 *
 * This version of the memory allocation subsystem omits all
 * use of malloc(). The application gives a block of memory
 * from which allocations are made and returned by the mplite_malloc()
 * and mplite_realloc() implementations.
 *
 * This memory allocator uses the following algorithm:
 *
 *   1.  All memory allocation sizes are rounded up to a power of 2.
 *
 *   2.  If two adjacent free blocks are the halves of a larger block,
 *       then the two blocks are coalesced into the single larger block.
 *
 *   3.  New memory is allocated from the first available free block.
 *
 * This algorithm is described in: J. M. Robson. "Bounds for Some Functions
 * Concerning Dynamic Storage Allocation". Journal of the Association for
 * Computing Machinery, Volume 21, Number 8, July 1974, pages 491-499.
 *
 * Let n be the size of the largest allocation divided by the minimum
 * allocation size (after rounding all sizes up to a power of 2.)  Let M
 * be the maximum amount of memory ever outstanding at one time.  Let
 * N be the total amount of memory available for allocation.  Robson
 * proved that this memory allocator will never breakdown due to
 * fragmentation as long as the following constraint holds:
 *
 *      N >=  M*(1 + log2(n)/2) - n + 1
